Course Description: 
BIOL 5514. Biological Models in Python. 3 Credit Hours.

This course provides an introduction to the field of computational biology by implementing biological models in the Python programming language. In addition to coverage of the basics of the Python language, topics will include: phylogenetic tree models, implementation of Markov models for biological problems, data structures and algorithms for the analysis of biological sequences, and the use of popular Python modules relevant for biological modeling. Prior basic knowledge of evolutionary theory and of genetics/genomics is expected. Some prior scripting experience is helpful, but students are not required to have an extensive coding background. This is a hands-on computational lab course, with students working on problems in class using their laptop computers.
Level Registration Restrictions: Must be enrolled in one of the following Levels: Graduate.

Repeatability: This course may not be repeated for additional credits.
