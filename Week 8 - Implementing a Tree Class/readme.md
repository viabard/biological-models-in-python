A program that implements a tree/edge class for a newick string (one part).
This worksheet was made and is copyrighted (2020) by Dr. Jody Hey at Temple University

Write a program that:
- Implements a tree class and a node or an edge class
- in the tree class, have a function that reads in a file with a newick string for a tree and then identifies all the nodes (internal and external) and stores them in instances of the node or edge class
- have your tree class implement an overloading of str(), that is a __str__ method for the tree class that prints out basic information for each node as a table
- include branch length information if you can but not required
- run the program on the newick string generated using phyml on your data for last week's assignment 
- print to a file the information about the tree (using the overloading of str())
